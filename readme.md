BinFM
-----

#####What is this?
*BinFM converts any supplied binary file to a frequency modulated representaion, and outputs it as a wav file.*

#####Why?
*I had a weird dream about it once. It also involved ascii art (which BinFM doesn't. At least, not yet).*

#####How do I build it?
*Right now there is a visual studio solution provided for Windows. It ought to compile on other platforms but I'm in no hurry to test it.*

#####How do I use it?
*Drag and drop a file or pass a path to a file to BinFM on the command line. After some processing a wav file will be output to the working directory.*

#####The wav file is just a bunch of noise?
*Yup. Well, no, not exactly. But for all intents it may as well be ^_^*
